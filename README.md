### Project Description

One reason for choosing this mental health clinic management software for a Comp 400 project is the current lack of a similar system at the university The current method of booking appointments by phone is not efficient and causes inconvenience for patients and staff.

Technologies Used:
NodeJs, Angular, Git

a)	Things to fix:
•	When a user refreshes the page, the environment variables are destroyed, causing the application to not know what access (admin, doctor, or patient) to grant to the user.
•	The application should move from a CSV database to a proper database, as the use of a CSV file can be resource-intensive and may lead to unexpected errors if the data provided is incorrect.
•	The application should include better error handling and more robust testing, such as writing integration tests to ensure that different parts of the application are working correctly together.
•	The application should include a better user interface for a better user experience.


Future plans or roadmap
b)	Features to add:
•	To Add Billing, Prescription, sending notification, video calling features to the application
•	Better error handling and robust testing.
•	To make it accessible and inclusive for users with disabilities and diverse needs
